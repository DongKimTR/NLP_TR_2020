# AWS Product Reviews - NLP: Text Classification
To better understand our customer's experience with the products and to identify the reasons why a given product experience was negative.

# Datasets
The data set we will be using can be located here: https://course.fast.ai/datasets. We will be using the Amazon Reviews: Polarity dataset.

The data set is constructed by taking review score 1 and 2 as negative, and 4 and 5 as positive. Samples of score 3 is ignored.

In the dataset, class 1 is the negative (review score 1 and 2) and class 2 is the positive (review score 4 and 5).

# Modeling Strategy
We will be identifying the topics in which negative reviews fall into. We will be categorizing based high level categories, followed by (time allowing) sub-categories.

# End Goal
To better state the reasons for negative customer experience with products. To possibly show trends and probabilities of specific types of negative reviews.
